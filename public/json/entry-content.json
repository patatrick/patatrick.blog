It also includes interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals,datepickers.</p><p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p><p>But then I found a <a href=\"https://flowbite.com\">component library based on Tailwind CSS calledFlowbite</a>. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigationbars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes fromTailwind CSS.</p><figure><img src=\"https://flowbite.s3.amazonaws.com/typography-plugin/typography-image-1.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Digital art by Anonymous</figcaption></figure><h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2><p>First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework.Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from thedocumentation.</p><p>It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns,and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.</p><p>You can check out the <a href=\"https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/\">quickstartguide</a> to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you wantto build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you canpurge and minify the generated CSS.</p><p>You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can helpyou get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this <ahref=\"https://flowbite.com/docs/components/tables/\">comparison table</a> to better understandthe differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.</p><h2>When does design come in handy?</h2><p>While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototypingwill come in handy:</p><ol><li><strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can theyfollow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you‚Äôve designed? By running ausability test, you‚Äôll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it‚Äôs live;</li><li><strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displayingproperly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;</li><li><strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea byproviding your client with a hands-on experience;</li><li><strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an interactive medium to preview and testdesign elements, designers and developers can understand each other ‚Äî and the project ‚Äî better.</li></ol><h3>Laying the groundwork for best design</h3><p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p><p>Let's start by including the CSS file inside the <code>head</code> tag of your HTML.</p><h3>Understanding typography</h3><h4>Type properties</h4><p>A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique, certain shapes are shared acrossletters.

If you‚Äôre simply preparing a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelityprototype ‚Äî like a wireframe with placeholder images and some basic text ‚Äî would be more thanenough. But if you‚Äôre going for more intricate usability testing, a high-fidelity prototype ‚Äî withon-brand colors, fonts and imagery ‚Äî could help get more pointed results.</p><p><strong>Consider your user</strong>. To create an intuitive user flow, try to think as your userwould when interacting with your product. While you can fine-tune this during beta testing,considering your user‚Äôs needs and habits early on will save you time by setting you on the rightpath.</p><p><strong>Start from the inside out</strong>. A nice way to both organize your tasks and create moreuser-friendly prototypes is by building your prototypes ‚Äòinside out‚Äô. Start by focusing on what willbe important to your user, like a Buy now button or an image gallery, and list each element by orderof priority. This way, you‚Äôll be able to create a prototype that puts your users‚Äô needs at the heartof your design.</p><p>And there you have it! Everything you need to design and share prototypes ‚Äî right in Flowbite Figma.</p>",
